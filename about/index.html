        I help clients of all ages and stages see that <strong>“all foods can fit”</strong> — even as we work to 
        <span class="green-text">manage weight</span>, <span class="blue-text">improve heart health</span>, 
        <span class="red-text">reduce diabetes risk</span>, and so much more. 
        My heart holds a special place for family nutrition:

        <span class="purple-text">infancy</span>, <span class="teal-text">toddlerhood</span>, 
        and <span class="blue-text">childhood</span>. 
        I love helping families get a <strong>healthy start</strong>. 
        I follow <strong>research-based</strong> nutrition practices and apply my <strong>creativity</strong>, too. 
        I offer <strong>straightforward</strong> tips and equip clients to eat healthfully on any budget.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <div class="background-content">
      <p>My heart holds a special place for family nutrition: pregnancy, postpartum, infancy, toddlerhood, and childhood. As a mom of two, I understand how each stage holds unique challenges. My passion is to journey alongside families, teaching simple habit changes that can transform health and give a healthy start to all.</p>

      <p>Aside from family nutrition, I love counseling every age and stage, teaching how “all foods can fit” – even as we work to manage weight, improve heart health, reduce diabetes risk, and more. I enjoy communicating that nutrition can be simple and fit every budget. My sessions also include counseling on beginning exercise because I believe it holds an important role in a healthy lifestyle.</p>

      <p>As a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist in Nebraska, I am a Licensed Medical Nutrition Therapist. I achieved my Master of Medical Nutrition Degree at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. My primary experience has been in public health as a WIC dietitian and certified lactation counselor. I also work at my local YMCA as a group fitness instructor, weight loss program facilitator, and dietitian.</p>

      <p>I believe nutrition is a science and I follow research-based practices. Clients drive my work, and I love sprinkling creativity to personalize plans, share recipes, and provide ongoing support. Nutrition and exercise are my hobbies-turned-career, and it is a privilege to serve my community as a dietitian.</p>
